  <h1 class ="mt-3">GT In The New Way</h1>
  <h2 class ="mt-1">by Johann Maldonado - November 15th, 2021</h2>
  <p><b>
  Our society has a harsh aspect of making us choose one side on something ever since the day our very existence is solidified. One day it’s “What’s your favorite color?” or one of your parents jokingly going “Who’s your favorite parent?” Blink and it’s “Which party are you going to be voting for for that candidate to lead our country and have worldwide impact for the next four years?” and “Do you want to pursue this for the rest of your life?” We are never really given too much opportunity at other thoughts and that keeps our minds in such a hard-to-break bubble.

  Walking down the street, overshadowed by a large prison-like building young people spend many days in, not far from that of my own, lies illuminating light against a neutral but honest background. Going to the signal it emits, you’ll find yourself pulled into a new world. The world celebrates your arrival and hugs you with the scent of brewing coffee and tea, and some fresh baked sweets. Guaranteed, it’s not the most vibrant place ever - the environment consists of this brown and gray color scheme that makes even the oak wood appear distinct, but you still have to remember about the reality outside the world. Deeper in the world lies that not typical of this planet type: a couple rows of light-emitting and hypnotizing machines configured up with all the accessories to sink your eyes in. An odd pairing? No. A genius necessity? Probably. There’s blue running throughout here, yet smiles common in its inhabitants. This space was definitely not in the quadruple digits of square footage, yet there is no estimate of time one can say takes to explore it all. Sure, it’s a café and the stars of the show on the menu are sweets, but there is an electrifying taste to savor you can only really grasp if you’re <luc></luc>ky to stumble into it.

  Personally, I wasn’t exactly making the childhood memories most were living up at the time I stumbled into the planet. I followed the steps of most closed-off pre-teen boys and drowned out the problems outside with video games a good amount of the time. Then, my favorite video game at the time had an official league. And with teams based around cities, of course I was going to root for the New York team. After that, I heard word of watchparties being hosted on the days of their games and the rest is really history. In case you might exist in the thoughts of a decade ago around the people that would do this, not all of them were cishet white men. Hell, not even a majority were and the people in charge weren’t. No, see this is New York City, and a team for the people will be cheered on by all of its people. All types of people were congregating here, the sound of the chatter coating not just the space but the whole street. If you forgot to cheer one time the team made a play, your heart made the cheer for you. Your heart did not want to leave even if the next match was to go on after the team played. Even your senses went into overdrive taking in all around you. That was the 5 Deadly Venoms’ way of magic.

  There’s a saying that you never know what you truly have until you lose it but you also overly value something, some feeling, so much that it’s like a gem to you, if you can only have it for a while. Nevertheless, you may still be able to get fixes of it if you’re willing enough. I became a part of something. A larger collective. I participated, I saw how we evolved. The esports league we watched, the team we rooted for? They started acknowledging us, our efforts, our passion. And so one evolves with that. With only adrenaline and understanding around me, there leaves little time in the thick of things to acknowledge any outside darkness previously casted upon me from different group environments. People weren’t here because they were forced to, people were here because they wanted to.

  As the scales of this family glistened more, there were watch parties hosted in other places too. I could now add more too to conversations, in and out of my mind, starting to do away with that baby chick afraid to come out of its egg and letting in new energy that helped me crack the egg in a more effective manner. The foundation itself would later be closed for a while due to unfortunate worldwide historical events, but this foundation is what later let people prosper. GGs for everyone and a GT in this new way of gathering, just a good time.
